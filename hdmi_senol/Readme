I found Tang NAno 9K HDMI example very complex https://github.com/sipeed/TangNano-9K-example/tree/main/hdmi  and no documentation.  
While looking a simple HDMI example, I found https://www.fpga4fun.com/HDMI.html example written for Spartan
Modified it and adapted for Tang Nano 9K
Important Points: 
HDMI clock frequency seems not critical much for resolution. Although 25.2 MHz defined for 640x480, 27MHz working too. 
The resolution is defined by the horizontal sync (hSync) and vertical sync (vSync) signals, which determine the timing of the display. 
The pixel clock (clk) dictates the rate at which pixels are transmitted.
I user OSER10 builtin serializer, which requires 5xpixel clock. (probably serializin ad posedge and negedge, thats why it is no 10xpixel clock as in fpga4fun example)
I used rPLL to have both 27MHz pixel clock and 5x27 = 135MHz TMDS clock
Differential pairs are generated using ELVDS_OBUF, otherwise you will not see pairs at FloorPlanner
TMDS endoer is from fpga4fun
